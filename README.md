Description:
This project implements a Singly Linked List in C using a modular approach.

The program supports the following operations:

Insertion at the end

Deletion by value

Traversal (display the list)

Tool Description :

Programming Language : C

Editor : VS Code

Compiler : dev c++

Console Input/Output : 
The program runs in the console/terminal window.

User inputs menu choices and data values.

Outputs include linked list display and confirmation messages like "Deleted" or "Inserted".

Using this toolset, I successfully implemented a singly linked list in C with the operations of insertion, deletion, and traversal. The tools like the editor and compiler made it easier to write, test, and debug the program in a structured and systematic way.
